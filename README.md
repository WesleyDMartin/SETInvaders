# Summary
This was my first introduction into animation and game design, and I was happy enough with the outcome to want to share it. 
I tried to place an emphasis on the driver for the game rather than enhancing the game play itself. I found that this made
for an easily changeable game with a fast run time and quick response.

I attempted to document my decisions and design for this assignment in the [attached PDF file.](https://github.com/WesleyDMartin/SETInvaders/blob/master/wmartin9183_A2.pdf)
